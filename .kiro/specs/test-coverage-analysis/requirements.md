# Test Coverage Analysis Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for analyzing and ensuring comprehensive test coverage for all CLI usage examples documented in the README and example files. The goal is to identify gaps between documented functionality and actual test coverage, then create tests to ensure all documented scenarios work as expected.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CLI Usage Pattern Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all CLI usage patterns shown in the README to be tested, so that I can be confident the documented examples actually work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing README CLI examples THEN the system SHALL identify all unique CLI usage patterns
2. WHEN comparing with existing tests THEN the system SHALL identify which patterns are missing test coverage
3. WHEN a CLI pattern is documented THEN there SHALL be a corresponding test that validates the pattern works
4. WHEN CLI flags are documented THEN there SHALL be tests for both long and short flag variants
5. WHEN file-based slot examples are shown THEN there SHALL be tests that verify file-based slot functionality

### Requirement 2: Cross-Platform CLI Testing

**User Story:** As a developer working on different platforms, I want CLI functionality to be tested across platforms, so that cross-platform compatibility is ensured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN path separators are used in examples THEN tests SHALL verify both forward slash and platform-specific separators work
2. WHEN file paths are referenced THEN tests SHALL verify relative and absolute path handling
3. WHEN Unicode content is shown in examples THEN tests SHALL verify Unicode handling works correctly
4. WHEN special characters are used THEN tests SHALL verify proper character encoding and handling

### Requirement 3: JSON Configuration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer using JSON configurations, I want all JSON configuration patterns to be tested, so that complex configurations work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON configuration examples are documented THEN there SHALL be tests for each configuration pattern
2. WHEN nested JSON structures are shown THEN tests SHALL verify nested composition works correctly
3. WHEN JSON options are documented THEN tests SHALL verify each option behaves as described
4. WHEN JSON and CLI combinations are shown THEN tests SHALL verify CLI overrides work properly

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error scenarios and edge cases to be tested, so that the CLI handles errors gracefully as documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error scenarios are mentioned in documentation THEN there SHALL be tests that verify the error handling
2. WHEN missing files are referenced THEN tests SHALL verify graceful degradation
3. WHEN invalid configurations are used THEN tests SHALL verify appropriate error messages
4. WHEN edge cases are documented THEN tests SHALL verify the edge case behavior

### Requirement 5: Integration and Build System Testing

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the CLI into build systems, I want integration patterns to be tested, so that documented integration examples work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NPM script examples are shown THEN there SHALL be tests that verify the script patterns work
2. WHEN Makefile examples are documented THEN there SHALL be validation of the make targets
3. WHEN GitHub Actions examples are shown THEN there SHALL be validation of the workflow patterns
4. WHEN Deno task examples are documented THEN there SHALL be tests for Deno-specific functionality

### Requirement 6: Performance and Advanced Features

**User Story:** As a developer using advanced features, I want performance and advanced functionality to be tested, so that documented optimizations work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parallel processing is mentioned THEN tests SHALL verify parallel processing works correctly
2. WHEN caching is documented THEN tests SHALL verify caching functionality
3. WHEN depth limiting is shown THEN tests SHALL verify depth limiting works
4. WHEN circular dependency detection is mentioned THEN tests SHALL verify detection works

### Requirement 7: Real-World Scenario Testing

**User Story:** As a developer following real-world examples, I want complex scenarios to be tested, so that documented workflows are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation generation examples are shown THEN tests SHALL verify the complete workflow
2. WHEN blog post generation is documented THEN tests SHALL verify the blog generation process
3. WHEN multi-language site examples are shown THEN tests SHALL verify multi-language functionality
4. WHEN nested template examples are documented THEN tests SHALL verify complex nesting works
